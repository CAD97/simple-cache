There are more featureful cache implementations out there. You might want to use
one of them. This crate exists to be a very simple and obviously correct
implementation, following the same design philosophy as [simple-interner].
If you want a more featureful interface, use a different crate; this crate
exists to offer the availability of the simple one, and a starting place for
more specialized customizations.
